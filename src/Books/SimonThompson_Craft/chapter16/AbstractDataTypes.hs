{-
NOTE building calculator for numerical expressions.
Sets values of variables.
Store: current variable values.

Abstract data type (ADT): limited interface by means of specified set of
operatoins.
Example: we hide the information about how type Store is implemented.
Also note: if we export a type like this => Data without (..) then constructors are
not exported so we can only operate on type through functions defined on it.
Example module Store (Store, initial, value, update) where
Here, constructors of Store are not available so we can only operate on Store using its
functions.

{-
-- EXAMPLE  get input of customer arrivals (queues) and give output their
departures (decide how many bank clerks need to be working at certain times of the day).

1. type of input message: Inmess.
At a given time
    => no one arrives (No)
    => someone arrives (Yes (arrival time of customer) (time to serve them))

    => data InputMsg = No | Yes Arrival Service
       type Arrival = Integer
       type Service = Integer

2.outmess - type of output messages.At a given time, either
    =>  no one leaves (None)
    => or a person is discharged (Discharge) which takes the time the customer
    waited and time of their arrival and time it took to serve them.

    data OutputMsg = None | Discharge Arrival Wait Service
    type Wait = Integer


3. Two operations in a queue: add item and process quque by one-minute step.
This gives one minute's further processing to item at head of queue.
Two outcomes are possible: item might have its processing completed, generates an Outmess,
or further processing is needed.



4. ServerState models serving more than one quque. System receives one Inmess per minute.
Three principal operations on a server (collection of queues):
    1. add inmess to one of the queues.
    2. processing step
    3. combine a server step with allocation of Inmess to shortest queue in the server.

    Three other operations are necessary:
    1. make a starting server with appropriate number of empty queues.
    2. identify num queues in server
    3. identify shrotest queue in server.
